*I obtain my Ph.D degree from the Department of [Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/), **The Chinese University of Hong Kong**, supervised by [Prof. Qiang Xu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=eSiKPqUAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN). Before that, I got my M. Phil of EE from **Tsinghua University** in 2019. My current research interests span the fields of AIGC security, including red-teaming AICG services and designing safety countermeasures to counter potential threats. I am currently exploring new career opportunities and am open to discussing potential roles. Please feel free to contact me should my expertise align with your organizational needs. I look forward to the possibility of collaborating with innovative teams and contributing to exciting projects.*
