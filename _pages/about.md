*I am a final-year Ph.D. student of [CUhk REliable Laboratory (CURE)](https://cure-lab.github.io/), in the Department of [Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/), **The Chinese University of Hong Kong**, supervised by [Prof. Qiang Xu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=eSiKPqUAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN). Our lab is focused on AI security. Before that, I got my M. Phil of EE from **Tsinghua University** in 2019. My current research interests span the fields of AIGC security, including red-teaming AICG services and designing safety countermeasures to counter potential threats.*
